# theCatCried

The expression "the cat cried" is a Ukrainian phraseology that means a small amount of something. This phrase was chosen as funny for the first project on the Rails framework because it is a personal financial manager. The need for a new way of earning prompted me to start mastering a new profession. The phrase "money like a cat cried" is the most common use of this phraseology.
